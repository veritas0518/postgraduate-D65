I don't know why I'm so tired today. I usually don't take a nap at noon. Unexpectedly, I suddenly feel sleepy in the afternoon. I couldn't help sleeping for 10 minutes. I feel that the intensity of such learning is too high. Why is this industry so hard? I'm really convinced. I feel that programmers are really a painful industry and have a lot of things to do, I don't know when I can finish so many things. I didn't expect to have so many things to learn. Alas, if I had started crazy learning in my freshman year, China's environment is really a purgatory in the world.
